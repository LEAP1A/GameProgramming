# CS3113: Intro to Game Programming - James Zhang

Welcome to my CS3113 Intro to Game Programming repository! This repo contains assignments and projects in this class.

## HW1
This project includes loading texture and 2D animation. My program should have met all the requirements of the assignment including extra credits.
A red jet orbits around a stationary blue jet, rotating counterclockwise. Also, a blue jet orbits around a red jet, rotating clockwise. Both moving jets repeatedly scale up and down out of
the extra-credit requirement. The following screenshot shows the pattern.

## HW2
This project is a completed Pong game. All requirements are satisfied including extra credits.
- Start the game by pressing "SPACE". The ball will then be ejected in a random direction. The default game mode is two-player. The left paddle is controlled by "W" and "S", and the right paddle is controlled by "UP" and "DOWN.

- By pressing "t", the game will be switched to single-player mode. The left paddle will be uncontrollable and make a simple up and down motion. The right paddle can still be controlled.
- As the ball goes out of the screen, the player on the opposite side will be announced as the winner. A message will be printed on the screen.

- The number of balls can be changed, ranging from 1 to 3, simply by pressing 1/2/3. However, the winner will be the first player who loses a ball. The winner will not be updated for the second/third ball.
